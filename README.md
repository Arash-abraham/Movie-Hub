# Avesta 🌟

"Preserving ancient wisdom for modern times"

## About The Project

The Avesta project is now complete! While it's inspired by Laravel's elegance, it maintains a lightweight and focused approach that doesn't require extensive documentation.

### Why "Avesta"?

I chose this name to honor the memory of the ancient book that guided my ancestors through life's lessons generations ago. Just as the original Avesta provided wisdom, this framework aims to provide solid foundations for modern web development.

## Current Status ✅

- **Project**: Complete and functional
- **Architecture**: Professional Laravel-inspired structure
- **Testing**: Comprehensive checks completed
- **Stability**: No major errors detected

## Areas for Improvement 🔧

The framework is solid, but there's always room for growth:

- **Migrations**: Need some additional refinement
- **Features**: Could be expanded based on community needs

## Support & Contact 📬

I apologize in advance for any problems you might find and appreciate your feedback!

## Vision 🌍

My dream is to one day introduce this project on a global stage, creating something that makes all Persian speakers proud worldwide. This isn't just code—it's a piece of our heritage reimagined for the digital age.

## Final Thought 🙏

"Don't make it hard for yourself and just think about the path."
